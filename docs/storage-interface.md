# The Storage Interface

How Mako's table layer is shaped today. (Design history lives in git:
the plan documents `silo-masstree-api-unification.md`,
`mako-nontxn-api-plan.md`, and `ordered-index-trait-plan.md` were
removed after implementation; `git log --follow docs/` finds them.)

## One interface, three traits, three backends

The interface is authored as **rusty-cpp inline-Rust traits** in
`src/mako/storage/abstract_ordered_index.h` — the `#if RUSTYCPP_RUST`
block is the source of truth; the committed `GEN` block holds the
transpiler-lowered pure-virtual C++ classes:

- **`OrderedIndex`** — the non-transactional KV surface every backend
  implements: `get / put / insert / remove / scan / rscan` (+ `size`,
  `clear`, `get_table_id`, `get_is_remote`). Each op is
  self-contained and immediately visible; on Silo-backed tables it is
  an internal one-op OCC transaction, so writes replicate through the
  normal commit path. `put` returns "newly inserted"; `insert` is
  put-if-absent; `remove` returns "existed" (and is a direct raw
  write on mbta — a documented asymmetry). Must not be called from a
  thread with an open transaction.
- **`TxnOrderedIndex: OrderedIndex`** — the transactional ops, all
  prefixed: `tx_get / tx_put / tx_insert / tx_remove / tx_scan /
  tx_rscan / tx_scan_remote_one`, taking the opaque txn handle from
  `abstract_db::new_txn`.
- **`ShardParticipant`** — cross-shard 2PC RPC-handler ops
  (`shard_get / shard_put / shard_scan`) that stage into the serving
  thread's ambient Sto transaction; the coordinator drives
  commit/abort over later RPCs.
- **`FullOrderedIndex: TxnOrderedIndex + ShardParticipant`** — the
  full-role combination. `abstract_ordered_index` is an alias for it.

**No name has more than one spelling on the class surface**, and
there are no default arguments or string-key members — Rust traits
can't express them, and C++ overloading on a class invites name-hiding
bugs. Convenience spellings live in **free functions** (same header):
`tx_get(t, txn, key, value)` etc., with `std::string` keys and
default `max_bytes_read`/`arena` — free-function overload sets need
no `using`-declarations and may carry defaults.

## Value conventions

- **Non-txn ops: raw bytes both directions.** Backends apply their
  storage encoding internally (mbta wraps writes with `mako::Encode`;
  reads/scans come back stripped). This is what makes backends
  interchangeable.
- **Txn'd ops: caller encodes.** `tx_put`/`tx_insert` store a pointer
  into the caller's buffer until commit, so the caller must pass a
  `mako::Encode()`d value that outlives the commit.

## Backends (`src/mako/storage/`)

| class | layer | authored | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `masstree_ordered_index` | plain Masstree (L1) | DSL struct | implements `OrderedIndex` ONLY — "no transactions" is a type fact. Owns value buffers in the RCU arena (`[u32 len][bytes]`), frees RCU-deferred, every op pins a `scoped_rcu_region`. |
| `mbta_ordered_index` | Silo/STO | DSL struct (`mbta_wrapper.hh`) | remote/local dispatch in the DSL; per-verb C++ kernels own the exception boundary (`STD_OP` catch of `Transaction::Abort`, non-txn retry loops, RPC retries) and the `UPDATE_VS` bookkeeping. MassTrans (non-movable) sits behind a raw pointer; build via `mbta_index_build(name, table_id, is_remote)`. |
| `mbta_sharded_ordered_index` | Mako routing | DSL struct | FNV-1a per-key routing over `abstract_ordered_index*` shards; txn'd range reads visit every shard; non-txn scans are local-shard-only. |

Backends are chosen at construction; callers hold the narrowest
interface they need (`OrderedIndex*` for KV consumers,
`abstract_ordered_index*` where txn'd + 2PC roles are both required,
e.g. `ShardReceiver::open_tables_table_id`).

## Authoring & regenerating the DSL blocks

- Regenerate with `scripts/regen_storage_dsl.sh` (never bare
  `inline-rust --rewrite`): it wraps the transpiler and prefixes
  `inline` onto out-of-line definitions inside GEN regions — the
  transpiler's single-TU module precedent is an ODR violation in
  these multi-TU headers. `--check` is the drift guard.
- The transpiler binary is built from rusty-cpp **upstream main**
  (parked at `build_local/rusty-cpp-transpiler-<sha>`); the submodule
  pin does NOT move — upstream main dropped runtime headers rrr
  needs. Sound because GEN output is plain C++ with no rusty-runtime
  dependencies.
- Trait → interface lowering: `pub trait` (namespace scope; non-pub
  gets a TU-local wrapper). Struct + `#[cpp_inherit] impl Trait for
  Struct` ADJACENT to the struct lowers to direct inheritance (no
  adapter). For multi-trait backends: attach the empty
  `#[cpp_inherit] impl FullOrderedIndex for X {}` and put methods in
  the inherent `impl X` — merged members override inherited virtuals
  by signature.
- Lowering gotchas: `&self.field` lowers to a POINTER (C++ helpers
  take `const T*`); raw-pointer spellings need `using c_void = void;`
  style aliases; opaque C++ types (e.g. `oi_stats_map`,
  `shard_table_vec`) pass through single-ident aliases; DSL structs
  are move-only with a synthesized fieldwise ctor, so non-movable
  fields (masstree trees, MassTrans) live behind raw pointers.
- `oi_scan_callback` is the shared scan callback type (namespace
  scope, so traits can name it).

## Facades above this layer

`src/rocks_interface/` (RocksDB-style `ITable`/`IDatabase`/`Status`)
consumes this interface; see `docs/rocksdb_interface.md`.
